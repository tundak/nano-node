### What is BitcoinBlack?

---

BitcoinBlack is a community based currency focussed on a fair distribution and giving the power back to the people.
Fee free & Instant transactions are made over a secure decentralized network with very low energy output.<br>
The current version of Bitcoin Black is built upon a codebase fork of Nano.
It is neither a hard fork or soft fork of Nano as it does not share the same chain.

---
